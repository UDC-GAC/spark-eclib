# FIPS variants are those described in [Mendes et al, 2004]
# to configure Self and wSelf variants use the following parameters:
#     neighborhood_influence.name = FIPS (for Self) or wFIPS (for wSelf)
#     velocity_update.name = ConstrictionFactor (use the same value for c1 and c2 to have a 50% contribution of the particle´s own best)
#     self = false (setting self=true increases the contribution of the particle´s own best because it is also taken into account in the calculation of its neighborhood influence)
