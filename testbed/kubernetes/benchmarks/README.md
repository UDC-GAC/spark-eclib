This directory contains what is needed to run some Biological System models (i.e. B1-B5, Circadian, Nfkb or Mendes)
using the [AMIGO](http://gingproc.iim.csic.es/~amigo/index.html) toolbox.
**spark-eclib** imports the models from the `libSBeclib.so` library, located into the `lib` directory, 
that was compiled using the source code provided by the [Computational Biology Lab](https://www.bangalab.org)
(formerly [(Bio)Process Engineering Group](http://gingproc.iim.csic.es/)).
